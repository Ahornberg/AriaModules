Hello, I don't know C++.

I don't really know my way around git either. Much less around github.

I also know nothing about DSP.

Oh, also, I don't know music theory. Nice to meet you. I'm your project maintainer. I just sort of do things until my modules happen to work.

Also I'm not big on acting all professional like in a hobby project. IDGAF about American open-source as unpaid internship github punchard bullshit decorum, go to hell if that's your vibe.

With that said: help is more than welcome!!!

Here's what to expect:

- Bug reports are always, always appreciated. Especially if you make it easy for me to reproduce them.
- Feature requests are welcome! 
- But feature requests for things that would just spare you the trouble of patching an attenuator or similarly common utility module are unlikely to be considered. I prefer modules that do one task well, and trust me to actually take advantage of the whole modular thing.
- Pull requests that fix bugs, increase performance, or simplify bad code are very likely to be merged.
- Pull requests that add features without consulting with me first might not be merged.
- Pull requests that do not follow (or elegantly expand upon) my established visual language will not be merged. Please consult with me first - I can do the visual design if you wish to implement something. 

I'm a big fan of working documentation first, visual design second, code last. When looking at stuff under construction, expect to see things that are documented but not implemented yet. 

By contributing anything, you understand your contributions will be released under the license of the repository (WTFPL 2.0). That's basically a dedication to the public domain except the license also has an edgy swear word in its name. I'm insulting your intelligence by saying that, but lawyers are paid to be stupid so they need me to state the obvious shit outright.
