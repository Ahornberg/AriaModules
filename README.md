Aria Salvatrice's VCV Rack Plugins
==================================

Hiya hello hey hi. These here are a buncha cool modules what for [VCV Rack][]. By buncha I mean there's one so far, but one day there might be like over three of them. Neato.


Modules (pluralized so I don't have to change the readme once I make more stuff)

### Splirge ###
Splirge is cute little four channel polyphonic split and merge that slots anywhere you can spare 3hp. When you don't need all 16 channels, Splirge will save you 7hp over using VCV Fundamental's Split and Merge.

The word "Splirge" seems to have been coined by the late Håkan Müller as part of [a Reason Rack Extension](https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/rack-extension/mxsplirger-cv-flexible-split-merge/), and I think it's a cool word.
