Aria Salvatrice's VCV Rack Plugins
==================================

Splirge is cute little four channel polyphonic split and merge that slots anywhere you can spare 3hp. When you don't need all 16 channels, Splirge will save you 7hp over using VCV Fundamental's Split and Merge.

The word "Splirge" seems to have been coined by the late Håkan Müller as part of [a Reason Rack Extension](https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/rack-extension/mxsplirger-cv-flexible-split-merge/), and I think it's a cool word.

The Aria Salvatrice VCV Rack Plugins modules are distributed under the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License version 2. It comes without any warranty, the usual.

If you fork my modules for some bizarre reason, remove my signature from the faceplates. You can easily do it by blanking the `res/components/signature.svg` file. If you could also be nice enough to alter the color scheme that'd rule.
