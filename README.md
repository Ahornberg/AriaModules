Aria Salvatrice's VCV Rack Plugins
==================================

Hiya hello hey hi, gamers. These here are some cool lil modules for [VCV Rack][]. 


Modules
-------

### Splirge ###
Splirge is cute little four channel polyphonic split and merge that slots anywhere you can spare 3hp. When you don't need all 16 channels, Splirge will save you 7hp over using VCV's official Split and Merge.

The word "Splirge" was [coined by Håkan Müller](https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/rack-extension/mxsplirger-cv-flexible-split-merge/) as part of a Reason Rack Extension.
